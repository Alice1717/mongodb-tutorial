## Q1 MongoDB Tutorial?
MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for a more natural representation of complex data structures compared to traditional relational databases.

## Q3 Download and Install MongoDB Server?
Setting up MongoDB involves several steps, including downloading and installing MongoDB, configuring it, and starting the MongoDB server. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/setup)

## Q4 Create Database?
To create a database in MongoDB, we typically don't need to explicitly create one. MongoDB creates a database when we first store data in that database. However, we can switch to a specific database or create one using the following steps: [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/create-database)

## Q5 Create Collection In MongoDB?
To create a collection in MongoDB, we generally don't need to create one explicitly.  Collections are created automatically when we insert documents into them. However, if we want to ensure that a collection is created or we want to create an empty collection explicitly, we can do so using the MongoDB client or a MongoDB shell.

## Q6 Add Document?
To add a document (or multiple documents) to a collection in MongoDB. We can use the "insertOne()" method to add a single document. For Multiple Entries, we can use "insertMany()" method to add multiple documents.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/add-document)

## Q7 Find Document?
To find documents in MongoDB, we can use the "find()" method. This method retrieves documents from a collection that match the specified query criteria.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/find-document)

## Q8 Update Document?
To update a document (or Multiple Documents) in MongoDB. we can use the "updateOne()" method to update a single document or the "updateMany()" method to update multiple documents that match specific criteria.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/update-document)

## Q9 Delete Document?
To delete a document (or Multiple Documents) in MongoDB. we can use the "deleteOne()" method to delete a single document or the "deleteMany()" method to delete multiple documents that match specific criteria.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/delete-document)

## Q10 Operators In MongoDB?
In MongoDB, operators are used to perform various operations in queries, updates, aggregations, and other operations. These operators enable us to manipulate data in the database in various ways.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/operators)

## Q11 Aggregate Method?
In MongoDB, aggregation is the process of transforming data sets and performing various operations on them to generate aggregated results. MongoDB provides the Aggregation Framework, which is a flexible and powerful tool for performing aggregation operations on collections of documents.

## Q12 Indexing In MongoDB?
Indexing in MongoDB is a crucial feature for improving query performance by efficiently retrieving documents from collections. MongoDB supports various types of indexes to optimize query execution. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/mongodb/indexing)

## Q13 Validations In MongoDB?
MongoDB provides document validation capabilities to enforce rules on the structure and content of documents stored in collections. Document validation ensures that data inserted or updated in a collection adheres to predefined rules, such as field types, value ranges, presence of certain fields, and more.

## Q14 Data APIs?
MongoDB provides several ways to interact with its data programmatically, including through various APIs and drivers. These APIs enable developers to interact with MongoDB databases using different programming languages and frameworks and enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, data manipulation, and querying.
